# HexagonClone
A simple clone of the game Super Hexagon created with JavaFX.

Collision detection was done using the Separating Axis Theorem which I have demoed [here](https://github.com/jeff-pancho/CollisionDemo).

## How to run with Eclipse

`git clone` the project somewhere

In Eclipse, go to `File -> Import` then click on `General -> Existing Projects into Workspace` then select the folder you cloned.

After that, simply run `Main.java` as it has the main method.

## Controls

Arrow keys to rotate the player

`R` to reset the game
